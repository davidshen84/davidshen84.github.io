# Linear Regression with Tensorflow

This is an example about how to use Tensorflow JS library to implement a simple linear regression algorithm.
In this example we will compute the `a` and `b` variables in this formula.

$$
Y = aX + b
$$


Users can provide training examples by clicking in the box blow.
The x-coordinates of the points will be used as the training data, \\( X \\);
while the y-coordinates will be used as training labels, \\( Y \\).
