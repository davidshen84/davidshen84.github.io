Simply list the tech stack, and some quotes from those project's website.


- [GAE](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)
  > Easy to build, Easy to scale, Easy to maintain
  >
  >  - Zero to sixty: Scale your app automatically without worrying about managing machines. 
  >  - Supercharged APIs: Supercharge your app with services such as Task Queue, XMPP, and Cloud SQL, all powered by the same infrastructure that powers the Google services you use every day.
  >  - You're in control: Manage your application with a simple, web-based dashboard allowing you to customize your app's performance.

- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/)
  > Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

- [AngularJS 1](https://angularjs.org/)
  > HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

- [Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown)
  > This is a Python implementation of John Gruberâ€™s Markdown. It is almost completely compliant with the reference implementation, though there are a few very minor differences.

- [EpicEditor](https://github.com/OscarGodson/EpicEditor)
  > EpicEditor is an embeddable JavaScript Markdown editor with split fullscreen editing, live previewing, automatic draft saving, offline support, and more. For developers, it offers a robust API, can be easily themed, and allows you to swap out the bundled Markdown parser with anything you throw at it.

- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
  > $$
    J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}\_{i=1}\sum^{K}\_{j=1} \left[- y^{(i)}\_k \log(h\_{\theta}(x^{(i)})\_k) - (1 - y^{(i)}\_k) \log(1 - h\_{\theta}(x^{(i)})\_k) \right]
    $$
  > Where \\( h_{\theta} \\) is the `sigmoid` function.
